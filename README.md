## louvijan
**louvijan** is a tool to control the script pipeline (not limited to Python scripts), which means that scripts can be executed in a specified order. In addition, it is recommended because it is lightweight, fast and easy to use.

Why does it have this strange name? Because it is similar to the pronunciation "liúshuǐxiàn" of pipeline in Chinese.

## Installation
You can install `louvijan` with `pip`:

```sh
pip install louvijan
```

## Examples
In one word, easy to use! After reading, please show your thumb.

If you have a series of scripts that need to be executed in a certain order, as shown in the figure:

</div>


In the figure, A to G represent scripts respectively. First execute A, then execute B, C, D at the same time, then execute E, F at the same time, and finally execute G.

Let's describe it with louvijan:
```python
from louvijan import PipeLine
PipeLine('A', ['B', 'C', 'D'], ['E', 'F'], 'G')()
```

In practice, of course, the **absolute path** is strongly recommended.

If you want to execute B, C, D on a remote server, you can create a new configuration file `remote.conf`:

```sh
[remote]
ip = 127.0.0.1
port = 22
username = root
password = 123456
```

This is the case with louvijan:

```python
PipeLine('A', Python(['B', 'C', 'D'], config='remote.conf'), ['E', 'F'], 'G')()
```


It is able to also send you an email after the script execution succeeds or fails or regardless of success or failure, by adding options in the configuration file like this:

```sh
[email]
host = smtp.qq.com
username = 12345
port = 25
authcode = ************
sender = tanyee@qq.com
receivers = one@qq.com, two@qq.com, three@qq.com
send_mail_flag = always
```

You can execute the following statement to generate a configuration template file:

```python
from louvijan import Config
Config().template()
```

By setting the configuration file and multiple nested PipeLine, you can construct a variety of complex pipeline projects.

Moreover, it can print the information during the scripts running to the log file.
